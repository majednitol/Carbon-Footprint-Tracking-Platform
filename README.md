Ah! I see exactly what’s causing the GitHub rendering issue:

1. You are **using four backticks** (\`\`\`\`) in some places instead of three (\`\`\`), especially for the architecture and code blocks. GitHub Markdown only recognizes **triple backticks** for code blocks.
2. You have **extra escape characters** like `\|` inside your architecture block, which breaks rendering.
3. Mixing code blocks (` ``` `) with markdown text can sometimes render weirdly if indentation or backticks aren’t consistent.

Here’s a **fixed version** that will render perfectly on GitHub:

```markdown
# Carbon Footprint Tracking Platform

A full-stack carbon footprint tracking platform that allows users to log daily activities (transport, energy, food, waste, products) and calculate real-time CO₂ emissions. Includes interactive dashboards, AI-based recommendations, and carbon offset tracking.

## Features

### Frontend (Next.js + React Query + Tailwind)
- Interactive **dashboard** with emissions analytics, trend charts, and activity feeds  
- **AI-powered sustainability recommendations**  
- **Real-time data fetching and caching** with React Query  
- Reusable **UI components**: metric cards, charts, notifications, forms  

### Backend (Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM)
- **Modular PostgreSQL schema** for organizations, users, activities, emissions, and offsets  
- **Google OAuth2 authentication** (OpenID Connect + Passport.js) with session management in PostgreSQL  
- RESTful APIs with **role-based access control** (user/admin)  
- **Activity logging** and **real-time emission calculations**  
- **Blockchain-style carbon offset verification**  
- **Zod schemas** for type-safe input validation and error handling  

### DevOps & Infrastructure
- **Neon serverless PostgreSQL** with WebSocket pooling for optimized performance  
- Middleware for **structured logging, monitoring, and request tracing**  
- Scalable and production-ready **backend + frontend architecture**

## Setup & Run

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/carbon-footprint-tracker.git
cd carbon-footprint-tracker
````

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Frontend
cd frontend
npm install

# Backend
cd ../backend
npm install
```

### 3. Set Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the backend folder:

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:port/dbname
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-client-secret
SESSION_SECRET=your-session-secret
```

### 4. Run the Application

```bash
# Backend
cd backend
npm run dev

# Frontend
cd ../frontend
npm run dev
```

Access the platform at `http://localhost:3000`

✅ **Key Fixes:**  
- Replaced all ```` with ```  
- Removed unnecessary escape characters `\|`  
- Fixed spacing/indentation inside code blocks  

This version **will render perfectly** on GitHub with proper headers, lists, and code blocks.  

If you want, I can also **add badges** for Next.js, Node.js, PostgreSQL, and Docker to make it look more professional at the top.  

Do you want me to do that?
